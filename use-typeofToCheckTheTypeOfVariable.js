//Debugging: Use typeof to Check the Type of a Variable

//Add two console.log() statements to check the typeof each of the two variables seven and three in the code.
/*JavaScript recognizes six primitive (immutable) data types: Boolean, Null, Undefined, Number, String, and Symbol (new with ES6) and one type for mutable items: Object. Note that in JavaScript, arrays are technically a type of object.*/

let seven = 7;
let three = "3";
console.log(seven + three);
// Add your code below this line


console.log(typeof seven); //logs number
console.log(typeof three);//logs string
